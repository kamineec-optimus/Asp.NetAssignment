Static Variable.

we have only one copy of static variable in the program that acts globally 
means only one instance of a given variable exists for a class and all 
objects share one copy of the static variable in memory

that is why in this program we have changed the currInterestRate to 0.08 so
 further all the object will use this value of currInterestRate 

Static Method.

We can call static method(using class name with dot operator) without creating the object of class
