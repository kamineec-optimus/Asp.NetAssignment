Answer1. This code will not run because _age variable will be 
inaccessible in CollegeStudent class due to its protection level.
Access specifier of _age is protected so it will only be accessible
within its child class.

Answer2. This code also will not run because _age variable is declared 
as protected internal means it can be accessed from any code within the same
assembly and from the other assembly class as-well but that class must drived
from the class where the variable has actually declared.
So as class univPeople does not drived from  Student class 
so _age variable will not be eccessed here.
